- Accent color: Analogous cyan color (#458dad) for highlighting active states and key actions.
- Body text: 'Inter', sans-serif, for its neutral, modern legibility, and adaptability.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a slightly futuristic and strong presentation.
- Use system-standard emojis for event categories. Design custom icons for settings or less-common actions.
- Calendar should take up the full width on mobile, and use a card layout on larger screens. Use clear, intuitive grid spacing.
- Subtle animations on theme switch and transitions when opening or closing panels.
